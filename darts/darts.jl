""" 
This function receives a coordinate pair (x, y) representing
a dart throw in a game and returns a score according to the following:
If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.
The outer circle has a radius of 10 units 
(This is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), 
the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1. 
They are all centered to the same point (That is, the circles are concentric) 
defined by the coordinates (0, 0).
